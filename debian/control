Description:  Perl API to the YAZ generic front-end server (Z39.50 server). 
 The SimpleServer module is a tool for constructing Z39.50 "Information
 Retrieval" servers in Perl. The module is easy to use, but it
 does help to have an understanding of the Z39.50 query
 structure and the construction of structured retrieval records.
